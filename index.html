            Sushma Swaraj was an Indian lawyer, politician, and diplomat who
            served as the Minister of External Affairs of India in the first
            Narendra Modi government from 2014 to 2019. She is only the second
            person to complete the 5-year term as Minister of External Affairs
            after Jawaharlal Nehru. She became the Minister of External Affairs
            in the union cabinet on 26 May 2014. Swaraj was called India's
            "best-loved politician" by the US daily Wall Street Journal.[5][6]
            She decided not to contest the 2019 Indian general election due to
            health reasons as she was recovering from a kidney transplant and
            needed to "save herself from dust and stay safe from infection" and
            hence did not join the second Modi Ministry in 2019.
